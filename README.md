### Code Explanation:
1. **Initialize the Client**:
   - The `@standard-crypto/farcaster-js` library is used to interact with Farcaster.
   - A mnemonic phrase (or private key) is used for authentication.

2. **Create the Frame**:
   - The frame consists of a title (`title`), description (`description`), image (`image`), and buttons (`buttons`).
   - Each button has a label (`label`), action (`action`), and target (`target`), which is the URL where the request is sent when the button is clicked.

3. **Publish the Frame**:
   - The frame is embedded in a post (cast) and published to Farcaster.

### How It Works:
- When a user sees your post on Farcaster, they can interact with the frame (e.g., click a button).
- When the button is clicked, a request is sent to the specified URL (`target`), where you can handle the action (e.g., save data or update the state).

### Additional Features:
- You can add multiple buttons, change images, and even dynamically update the frame based on user actions.
- To handle actions on the server, you can use any backend (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).
